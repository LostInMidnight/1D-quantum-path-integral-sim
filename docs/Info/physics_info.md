# Physics Background: Path Integral Formulation of Quantum Mechanics

## Introduction

This simulation implements the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, developed by Richard Feynman. Instead of solving the Schrödinger equation directly, the path integral approach considers all possible paths a quantum particle can take between two points and sums their quantum mechanical contributions.

## Mathematical Foundation

### The Path Integral

The quantum mechanical amplitude for a particle to propagate from position x₀ at time t₀ to position xf at time tf is given by:

```
K(xf,tf; x₀,t₀) = ∫ Dx(t) exp(iS[x(t)]/ℏ)
```

Where:
- **K** is the propagator (transition amplitude)
- **S[x(t)]** is the classical action functional
- **∫ Dx(t)** represents integration over all possible paths
- **ℏ** is the reduced Planck's constant

### Classical Action

The action functional is defined as:

```
S[x(t)] = ∫[t₀ to tf] L(x,ẋ,t) dt
```

Where **L** is the Lagrangian. For a particle in a potential V(x):

```
L = (1/2)mẋ² - V(x)
```

### Discretization on a Lattice

To make the path integral computationally tractable, we discretize space-time on a lattice:

1. **Time discretization**: t = nΔt, where n = 0, 1, ..., N
2. **Path discretization**: x(t) → {x₀, x₁, x₂, ..., xN}
3. **Action discretization**: 

```
S ≈ Σ[n=1 to N] [(1/2)m((xn - xn-1)/Δt)² - V(xn)] Δt
```

### Quantum Amplitudes

Each path contributes to the total amplitude with weight:

```
A[path] = exp(iS[path]/ℏ)
```

This complex number encodes:
- **Phase**: arg(A) = S/ℏ (determines interference patterns)
- **Magnitude**: |A| = 1 (all paths contribute equally in magnitude)

## Implementation Details

### Monte Carlo Sampling

Since we cannot integrate over all possible paths analytically, we use Monte Carlo sampling:

1. Generate random paths between fixed endpoints
2. Calculate each path's action
3. Compute quantum amplitude for each path
4. Sum contributions (with proper normalization)

### Path Generation Algorithm

1. **Linear interpolation**: Start with straight-line path between endpoints
2. **Random fluctuations**: Add Gaussian noise to intermediate points
3. **Boundary conditions**: Keep endpoints fixed

```cpp
for (int t = 1; t < TIME_STEPS; t++) {
    double alpha = (double)t / TIME_STEPS;
    path[t] = (1 - alpha) * x0 + alpha * xf;  // Linear interpolation
    path[t] += gaussian(rng) * 0.5;           // Random fluctuation
}
```

### Harmonic Oscillator Potential

The simulation uses a harmonic oscillator potential:

```
V(x) = (1/2)kx² = (1/2)x²  (with k = 1)
```

This choice provides:
- **Analytical solutions** for comparison
- **Stable, bounded motion**
- **Clear demonstration** of quantum interference effects

## Physical Interpretation

### Classical vs Quantum Paths

- **Classical mechanics**: Particle follows single path minimizing action (Euler-Lagrange equation)
- **Quantum mechanics**: Particle "explores" all possible paths simultaneously
- **Interference**: Paths with similar phases interfere constructively, others destructively

### Visualization Elements

#### Path Colors
- **Hue (color)**: Represents quantum phase φ = S/ℏ
  - Different colors show different phases
  - Phase determines interference patterns
- **Brightness**: Represents amplitude magnitude |A|
  - After normalization, related to path probability density
  - Brighter paths contribute more to final amplitude

#### Key Features
- **Red dots**: Initial and final positions (boundary conditions)
- **Blue curve**: Harmonic potential V(x) = ½x²
- **Colored paths**: Sample of possible quantum trajectories
- **Grid**: Lattice discretization visualization

### Parameter Effects

#### Physical Parameters
- **ℏ (Planck's constant)**:
  - Smaller ℏ → more classical behavior
  - Larger ℏ → more quantum fluctuations
  - Controls quantum-to-classical transition

- **Mass (m)**:
  - Heavier particles → less quantum spreading
  - Lighter particles → more path exploration
  - Affects kinetic energy contribution

#### Numerical Parameters
- **Time Steps**: Lattice resolution in temporal direction
- **Number of Paths**: Monte Carlo sample size
- **dt, dx**: Discretization step sizes

## Quantum Mechanical Principles Demonstrated

### 1. Superposition
All paths exist simultaneously and contribute to the final amplitude.

### 2. Interference
Paths with similar phases reinforce each other, while paths with different phases can cancel out.

### 3. Uncertainty Principle
The quantum nature prevents precise knowledge of both position and momentum along the path.

### 4. Correspondence Principle
As ℏ → 0 or mass → ∞, the simulation approaches classical behavior where only the action-minimizing path dominates.

## Numerical Considerations

### Convergence
- More paths → better statistical sampling
- Smaller time steps → better temporal resolution
- Proper normalization ensures amplitude conservation

### Stability
- Boundary conditions maintain fixed endpoints
- Gaussian fluctuations provide ergodic path sampling
- Complex arithmetic preserves quantum phases

### Performance Optimization
- WebGL shaders for efficient rendering
- Batch processing of path calculations
- Optimized memory management for large path sets

## Extensions and Applications

### Possible Modifications
1. **Different potentials**: Barrier penetration, double wells
2. **Multiple particles**: Quantum statistics effects
3. **Higher dimensions**: 2D/3D path integrals
4. **Time-dependent potentials**: Driven quantum systems

### Educational Value
- **Visualizes abstract quantum concepts**
- **Shows emergence of classical behavior**
- **Demonstrates computational quantum mechanics**
- **Interactive parameter exploration**

## Mathematical Appendix

### Action Calculation Details
For discrete paths with N time steps:

```
S = Σ[i=1 to N] [(m/2)((xi - xi-1)/Δt)² - V(xi)] Δt
```

### Normalization Procedure
After generating all paths, amplitudes are normalized:

```
Anormalized = A / Σ[all paths] A
```

This ensures proper quantum mechanical normalization and makes visualization meaningful.

### Statistical Error Estimation
With N Monte Carlo samples, statistical error scales as 1/√N, making convergence assessment possible for validation of results.
